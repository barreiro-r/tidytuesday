Hey there, and welcome to my TidyTuesday gallery! Â ðŸ‘‹

If you're not familiar, [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main) is this awesome weekly data challenge run by the R for Data Science online community. Every week, they release a brand new dataset, and I jump at the chance to practice my data wrangling and visualization skills in R (and Python).

For each entry, you'll find my code, the visuals I came up with. 

I love seeing what stories the numbers can tell and I hope you enjoy it too!
