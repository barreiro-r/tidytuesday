## About the Data

::: callout-note
{{< iconify line-md:github-loop >}} Check data in [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-07-01/readme.md) GitHub repository.
:::

This week we're exploring weekly US gas prices! The data comes from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), which publishes average retail gasoline and diesel prices each Monday. The original data (including additional datasets) can be found at eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel, and the weekly time series used here was downloaded from this XLS file.

Gas price methodology:

> "Every Monday, retail prices for all three grades of gasoline are collected mainly by telephone and email from a sample of approximately 1,000 retail gasoline outlets. The prices are published around 5:00 p.m. ET Monday, except on government holidays, when the data are released on Tuesday (but still represent Monday's price). The reported price includes all taxes and is the cash pump price paid by a consumer as of 8:00 a.m. Monday. This price represents the self-serve price except in areas having only full-serve. The price data from the sample are used to calculate volume-weighted average gasoline price estimates at the national, regional, and selected city and state levels for all gasoline grades and formulations."

Diesel price methodology:

> "Every Monday, cash self-serve on-highway diesel prices (including taxes) are collected from a sample of approximately 590 retail diesel outlets in the continental United States. The sample includes a combination of truck stops and service stations that sell on-highway diesel fuel. The data represent the price of ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD), which contains less than 15 parts-per-million sulfur. All collected prices are subjected to automated edit checks during data collection and data processing. Data flagged by the edits are verified with the respondents. Imputation is used for companies that cannot be contacted and for reported prices that are extreme outliers. The average survey response rate for 2020 was 98%. Average national and regional prices are released around 5:00 p.m. ET on Mondays, except on government holidays, in which case the data are released on Tuesday (but still represent Monday's price)."

### 1.3 Load this week's data
```{r}
#| label: Load TidyTuesday data

weekly_gas_prices <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-07-01/weekly_gas_prices.csv')

```



## 2 Data analysis

### How much data we have for all categories?
```{r}
#| label: Categories compairson
weekly_gas_prices |> count(fuel, grade, formulation)
```

Not so complete for diesel `low_sulfur` and `ultra_low_sulfur`.

### When data started to be collected?

```{r}
#| label: When data started to be collected?

recording_range <- 
  weekly_gas_prices |>
  group_by(fuel, grade, formulation) |>
  filter(date %in% c(min(date), max(date))) |>
  mutate(date_categ = if_else(date == min(date), 'min_date', 'max_date')) |>
  select(-price)

recording_range |>
  mutate(formulation = if_else(is.na(formulation), 'NA', formulation)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = str_c(fuel,grade,formulation, sep = ' '))) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 4, color = cool_gray4, lineend = 'round') +
  geom_point(aes(color = date_categ), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(min_date = "white", max_date = cool_gray2)) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = NULL, title = "Fuel price per category")
```


## 3 Transform Data for Plotting

```{r}
#| label: Transform data for plotting
data2plot <- 
  weekly_gas_prices |>
  filter(date > as.Date('2000-01-01')) |>
  mutate(month = month(date)) |>
  mutate(year = year(date)) |>
  filter(fuel == 'gasoline') |>
  group_by(fuel, grade, formulation, month, year) |>
  mutate(price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  filter(grade != "all", formulation != "all") |>
  ungroup() |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = grade, values_from = price) |>
  mutate(delta_premium = premium - midgrade, delta_regular = regular - midgrade) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c(delta_premium, delta_regular), names_to = 'type', values_to = 'price')
